Case Study: Dynamic Portfolio Dashboard with React.Js, TypeScript, Tailwind & Node.Js

1. Introduction
Context
Modern investors need real-time insights into their portfolio performance to make informed
decisions—whether to buy, sell, hold, or add to positions. This case study challenges you to build a
dynamic web application that displays portfolio information, fetching live data from financial APIs.
Goal
Develop a portfolio dashboard using ReactJs/Next.js that retrieves stock data from:
• Yahoo Finance (for Current Market Price - CMP)
• Google Finance (for P/E Ratio and Latest Earnings)
The dashboard should be interactive and visually appealing.
Target Audience
This project assesses your ability to:
• Build a full-stack web application with React.js and Node JS
• Consume and process data from external APIs
• Handle asynchronous operations and data transformations
• Design a user-friendly interface for displaying financial data

2. Requirements
Data Sources
• Yahoo Finance API
Used to fetch real-time stock prices (CMP). Note: Yahoo Finance does not have a public
official API. Candidates should acknowledge this and propose solutions (e.g., scraping or
unofficial libraries).
• Google Finance API
Used to fetch P/E Ratio and latest earnings data. Similar to Yahoo Finance, scraping or
unofficial libraries are required.
Data Format: Use a structured format such as JSON to store and manipulate data.

Functionality
Portfolio Table
Display holdings in a tabular format with the following columns (go through the excel sheet):
• Particulars (Stock Name)
• Purchase Price
• Quantity (Qty)
• Investment (Purchase Price × Qty)
• Portfolio (%) (Proportional weight in the portfolio)
• NSE/BSE (Stock Exchange Code)
• CMP (Fetched from Yahoo Finance)
• Present Value (CMP × Qty)
• Gain/Loss (Present Value – Investment)
• P/E Ratio (Fetched from Google Finance)
• Latest Earnings (Fetched from Google Finance)
Dynamic Updates
CMP, Present Value, and Gain/Loss should update automatically at regular intervals (e.g., every 15
seconds).
Visual Indicators
Color-code Gain/Loss:
• Green for gains
• Red for losses
Sector Grouping
Group stocks by sector (e.g., Financials, Technology) with sector-level summaries:
• Total Investment
• Total Present Value
• Gain/Loss

Technology Stack
• Frontend: Next.js (React framework)
• Backend :NodeJs

• Styling: Tailwind CSS, Typescript
• Data Fetching: fetch, Axios, or similar
Recommended Libraries:
• react-table – Table display
• recharts – Optional charting for visualizations

3. Technical Challenges and Considerations
API Limitations
• Unofficial APIs / Scraping:
Yahoo and Google Finance require scraping or use of unofficial libraries that may break due
to site changes.
• Rate Limiting:
Public sources may have rate limits. Use caching, throttling, or batching to prevent blocks.
• Data Accuracy:
Scraped or unofficial data may vary in accuracy. Add disclaimers or verification logic if
needed.

Asynchronous Operations
• Use async/await or Promises to handle parallel API requests.
Data Transformation
• Clean and format the raw API data to match the required table schema.
Performance Optimization
• Caching: Use Next.js caching or a dedicated tool to reduce API calls
• Memoization: Use React.memo or similar for preventing unnecessary renders
Error Handling
• Handle API failures gracefully
• Display clear error messages for users
Security
• Do not expose API keys or sensitive data in client-side code

Real-Time Updates

Use setInterval for periodic refresh
• Optional: Use WebSockets for more advanced, efficient updates
Responsiveness
• Ensure dashboard layout adapts well across devices

4. Implementation Steps
1. Set Up Next.js Project
Use create-next-app to scaffold the project
2. Design Data Model
Define structure for individual stocks and the portfolio
3. API Integration
Write fetch functions for Yahoo and Google Finance data
4. Create Portfolio Table Component
Use react-table to render the portfolio
5. Implement Dynamic Updates
Use setInterval for live CMP and value refresh
6. Add Sector Grouping
Group by sector and show sector-wise summaries
7. Add Visual Indicators
Use CSS for green/red coloring of Gain/Loss
8. Implement Error Handling
Catch and display errors during data fetch or transformation
9. Optimize Performance
Add caching and memoization techniques
10. Deploy (Optional)
Deploy using Vercel, Netlify, or similar platforms

5. Evaluation Criteria
Solutions will be evaluated based on:
• Functionality: Does it meet the defined requirements?
• Code Quality: Is the code clean and maintainable?
• Performance: Is the dashboard fast and responsive?
• Error Handling: Are failures handled smoothly?

API Strategy: How are scraping/rate limits managed?
• User Interface: Is the UI intuitive and visually appealing?
• Problem Solving: Are the technical challenges addressed effectively?

6. Deliverables
• Source Code: Full Next.js application
• README: Setup and usage instructions
• Technical Document:
A short write-up explaining key challenges faced and your solutions
